# PSLaunch
PS Launch for PeopleSoft or other websites

This is a simple IOS application that was created to allow the user to scan a URL from a QR Code or other image.

The original intent was to be used with a PeopleSoft environment but since you can encode any url, you can use the application to go to any url that you can scan.

XCode 7.3.1
